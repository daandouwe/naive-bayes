# Naive bayes text classifier
Text classification with a naive Bayes classifier.

## Setup
To get the movie-reviews data, type:
```bash
cd
./get-data.
```

## Usage
For the original 5-class movie-reviews, type:
```bash
./main.py --data data/classes
```

For the binarised reviews, use:
```bash
./main.py --data data/binary
```

You can add the following arguments:
```bash
--remove 10  # Remove 10 most frequent that are in all classes.
--no-punct   # Remove punctuation (except ! and ?) from data.
--no-stop    # Remove stop-words from data.
```

## Results
Surprisingly, accuracy is best when both stop-words and punctuation are left as is. We show with removing

On the binarized movie reviews, the results are (with some highest conditional probabilities):
